## 🚀 Key Features

* **Multi-Organization Support:** Manage multiple distinct entities (e.g., Tim vs. Lobo) from a single deployment with custom themes for each.
* **Unlimited Local Storage:** Uses **IndexedDB** (via `idb-keyval`) to support thousands of SKUs and high-resolution images, bypassing standard browser storage limits.
* **Visual Sales Analytics:** New interactive **Sales Trend Report** graphs daily sales rates over time (3m, 6m, 1y) to identify seasonality and velocity changes.
* **Reorder Planner:** Automatically calculates sales rates, lead times, and "Days Until Stockout" to suggest exactly when and what to reorder.
* **Purchase Order (PO) Tracking:** Complete lifecycle management for POs (Placed -> Received), including partial receiving logic and vendor tracking.
* **Lead Time & Variance Analysis:** Tracks "Actual vs. Planned" lead times and grades ETA accuracy to help you manage vendor performance.
* **Smart Cloud Sync:**
    * Links to a local file (e.g., inside your Google Drive/Dropbox folder) to sync data across devices.
    * **Sync Safety:** Prevents closing the tab while data is syncing to avoid corruption.
* **Secure Access:** Application access is protected via **SHA-256** password hashing.

* ## ⚙️ Configuration

To customize the application, create a `.env` file in the project root:

### 1. Define Organizations
You can override the default organizations by providing a JSON string in `VITE_ORG_CONFIG`.
* **id:** Unique internal ID for the database.
* **name:** Display name.
* **description:** Subtitle text on the login card.
* **themeColor:** Hex code for the dashboard accent color.

```
VITE_ORG_CONFIG='[
  {
    "id": "lobo",
    "name": "Lobo Tool Co.",
    "description": "Main Inventory",
    "themeColor": "#3b82f6"
  },
  {
    "id": "timothy",
    "name": "Timothy Corp",
    "description": "Spare Parts",
    "themeColor": "#10b981"
  }
]'
```
### 2. Set Access Password
Generate a SHA-256 hash of your desired password and set it here.
```
VITE_APP_PASSWORD=your_sha256_hash_here
```

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React (Vite)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + Lucide React (Icons)
* **Storage:** IndexedDB (via `idb-keyval`)
* **File System:** File System Access API (native browser file picker)
* **Exporting:** XLSX (SheetJS/ExcelJS) for comprehensive reporting

## 💾 Data & Storage Guide

### 1. Where is my data?
Your data lives in **IndexedDB** inside your specific browser instance.
* **Pros:** Fast, private, works offline.
* **Cons:** If your computer dies or you clear site data, it is gone. **You must use Cloud Sync.**

### 2. How to set up Cloud Sync
To back up your data or share it between a laptop and desktop:
1.  Go to the **Settings** tab.
2.  Click **"Link to Database File"**.
3.  Create or select a `.json` file inside a synced folder (like Dropbox, OneDrive, or Google Drive).
4.  The app will now auto-save to that file every time you make a change.

> **Note:** Cloud Sync requires a Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge, Opera, Brave). Firefox and Safari do not currently support the File System Access API.

### 3. Maintenance Tools
* **Manual Backup:** You can download a full JSON dump of your database (including images) from the Settings tab at any time.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

* **Browser Compatibility:** For the best experience (especially image uploading and Cloud Sync), use **Google Chrome** or **Microsoft Edge**.
* **Security:** Ensure your `.env` file is updated with the SHA-256 hash of your desired password (`VITE_APP_PASSWORD`).
